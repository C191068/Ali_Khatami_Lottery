# Ali_Khatami_SmartContract_Lottery(learning from the video of Patrick Collins)

### Introduction

Here we are building an application that allow users completely decentralized to allow use to engage in a fair , verifiable random lottery <br>

This application will fix McDonald issue that we talked much earlier <br>

To do this to get a pure verifiable random number we gonna use Chainlink VRF to get pure verifiable random number <br>

Then we gonna use chainlink keepers to trigger the automation to automatically have one of these winners get <br>

picked every time one of those time intervals is up <br>
