# Ali_Khatami_SmartContract_Lottery(learning from the video of Patrick Collins)

### Introduction

Here we are building an application that allow users completely decentralized to allow use to engage in a fair , verifiable random lottery <br>

This application will fix McDonald issue that we talked much earlier <br>

To do this to get a pure verifiable random number we gonna use Chainlink VRF to get pure verifiable random number <br>

Then we gonna use chainlink keepers to trigger the automation to automatically have one of these winners get <br>

picked every time one of those time intervals is up <br>


### Hardhat Setup
![l1](https://github.com/C191068/Ali_Khatami_Lottery/assets/89090776/d673276a-9eb6-469e-b1e7-f9e8f4ba00bb)
Here the above we opened a new folder <br>

![l2](https://github.com/C191068/Ali_Khatami_Lottery/assets/89090776/0cdbcbaf-9b2a-4d0c-8e8e-958f59f09b0d)

Then we run the above command ```yarn add --dev hardhat``` <br>

![l4](https://github.com/C191068/Ali_Khatami_Lottery/assets/89090776/1aa9735d-d9fe-4c2e-a864-b7b5f3f2b943)

Then we wil give the above command yarn hardhat and then select ```Create an empty hardhat.config.js``` <br>

because we gonna add customization to our project <br>

![l5](https://github.com/C191068/Ali_Khatami_Lottery/assets/89090776/b4d45b17-3c54-4ecf-85f7-8c307e5ead55)
Now we have here blank hardhat.config.js file <br>

![l6](https://github.com/C191068/Ali_Khatami_Lottery/assets/89090776/07b858b6-7461-48e3-9506-bdf0f13420a5)
To bring yarn.lock we give the above two commands <br>

![l7](https://github.com/C191068/Ali_Khatami_Lottery/assets/89090776/ce37199a-fde8-4532-b282-ab7b27c0fe61)

Then we give the below command above <br>

```
yarn add --dev @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers@npm:hardhat-deploy-ethers ethers @nomiclabs/hardhat-etherscan @nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle chai ethereum-waffle hardhat hardhat-contract-sizer hardhat-deploy hardhat-gas-reporter prettier prettier-plugin-solidity solhint solidity-coverage dotenv

```

Remember at the end of the day the best for you and best for your job is the tool that you like the most <br>


![l8](https://github.com/C191068/Ali_Khatami_Lottery/assets/89090776/3b5c8e59-84d8-4502-8a72-664e01138cf8)

by going to the link below:

https://github.com/PatrickAlphaC/hardhat-smartcontract-lottery-fcc/blob/main/hardhat.config.js

we copy the above black arrow part <br>

![l9](https://github.com/C191068/Ali_Khatami_Lottery/assets/89090776/5998adf0-3a3c-4b26-a767-07e08bac0a75)

Then we paste it at the above hardhat.config.js file <br>

![l10](https://github.com/C191068/Ali_Khatami_Lottery/assets/89090776/b7bff0ae-9319-42bd-bc01-19ab51911e4b)

here we have created a new file .prettierrc and paste the code by going to the following link <br>

https://github.com/PatrickAlphaC/hardhat-smartcontract-lottery-fcc/blob/main/.prettierrc <br>

here ```printwidth=100``` means how long a line could be before it goes to a new line <br>

![l11](https://github.com/C191068/Ali_Khatami_Lottery/assets/89090776/b1100afa-e926-4cff-9825-b43af282b5ac)

then we can see all the semicolon goes away from tyhe above <br>

![l12](https://github.com/C191068/Ali_Khatami_Lottery/assets/89090776/51d15a77-448a-4234-845a-e451f2156d4c)
here the soilidity version we are using is ```0.8.19``` <br>



### akrkLottery.sol setup

![l13](https://github.com/C191068/Ali_Khatami_Lottery/assets/89090776/35e443bc-9346-4fc4-b835-323e75c8a61a)

We will give the following command above to install node modules <br>

```

 npm install --save-dev @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox

```


![l14](https://github.com/C191068/Ali_Khatami_Lottery/assets/89090776/2638a951-6a91-4bd0-a8bf-fe40013648dd)

We create a new folder ```contracts``` <br>


![l15](https://github.com/C191068/Ali_Khatami_Lottery/assets/89090776/e5a89c8b-63d9-4897-bd6f-949b53da5126)

we create a new file called ```akrkLottery.sol``` <br>

Here we want the people to enter the lottery(paying some amount) <br>

We probably want to pick a random winner and we want this to be verifiably random <br>

we want this to be untamperable <br>
We want winners to be selected every X minutes , months ,years <br>

We want to deploy this smart contract almost without any maintanence , almost nobody ever have to touch it again <br>

It will just automatically run forever <br>

This is the power of smart contracts <br>

Since we are picking some random number and we have some event driven execution <br>

For that we need to use Chainlink Oracle since we need to get randomness from outside the blockchain <br>

We gonna need to have that automated execution <br>

A smart contract can execute itself we need somebody automatically trigger this <br>
